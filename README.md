###A code challenge. Impress us!

This JS script loads binary data from races tracked by YB Tracking.  The data includes the time, position and distance-to-finish for each team during the race.

We’d love to see if you can add a new dimension to the data.  You might demonstrate a cool new feature that might be incorporated into our race viewer, or something novel just for the fun of it.  We're unlikely to be impressed by a Google Maps mashup, try to show us something we've never thought of.  It doesn't need to be sensible.

You’ve all the data you need to calculate speed/direction of the teams, feel free to embellish with additional dummy data if required to make your demo.  Feel free to use any additional libaries/frameworks - we’ll be primarily assessing your ideas and interpretation of the challenge, but we’ll also be looking out for good coding style and structure.  

We *don't* expect a finished product - but we *do* expect great user experience.  When you're done, upload it to github and send us a link to your project.

###Usage

You need to call `R7.load()`, supplying an eventName and some callback functions.

You can use these events:

- `c6002016`
- `arc2015`
- `fastnet2015`
